Analysis of data from a Kaggle.com competition

Kaggle.com was running a contest to predict the time to adoption for pets listed on the PetFinder.MY website.

The photographic data needed to be processed so machine learning algorithms can analyze the data. While sentiment data was provided it was decided that the descriptions would be used and text analysis done using a lexicon would be used. Three machine learning algorithms were used. Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors. Of these Random Forest done on the non-photographic data only provided the best results. The photographic data was problematic due to the inconsistency of the quality of the photographs.
